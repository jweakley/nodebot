This is my nodebot day scratch pad.

## How to:

1. Hook up Arduino.

2. Wire up Arduino to servos:

  Claw => Pin 9

  Arm => Pin 10

  Wrist => Pin 11

3. NPM Install & Run Node

  `npm install`

  `node app`

## Controls:
  Shift + Key will enable finer control movements.

  - [a] and [d] => Claw

  - [w] and [s] => Arm

  - [q] and [e] => Wrist
